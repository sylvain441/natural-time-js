# Natural time - JavaScript

Natural time is a fresh, elegant, and coherent way of measuring the movements of time here on the Earth.

This **new time standard** is based on common sense and the observation of natural cycles.

### JavaScript library

This repository contains the JavaScript implementation of natural time.  

`index.js`: This class translates artificial dates to natural dates.  
`context.js`: Collection of utility functions for calculating sky context and events like moon phase, sunrise and sunset ...

### White paper (specifications)

How are natural years, moons, days, and time defined ?  

Read the white paper (specifications) of natural time here: [github.com/sylvain441/natural-time-white-paper](https://github.com/sylvain441/natural-time-white-paper)

### Web application

You can play with natural time at [https://naturaltime.app/](https://naturaltime.app/). It both works online and offline thanks to this JavaScript library.

# Javascript API

> If you know how to deal with typescript/typings/documentation this repo may appreciate your help. [Contribute here](#contribute)

## Instalation

Install NPM package with your terminal:

```console
npm install -i natural-time-js
```

## `NaturalDate` Class

The `NaturalDate` class translates artificial dates into natural dates.    

```javascript
import { NaturalDate } from 'natural-time-js';

let artificialDate = new Date();
let longitude = 5.2;

let naturalDate = new NaturalDate(artificialDate, longitude);
```

Once instanciated, the `naturalDate` object holds many computed variables available for your usage:

```javascript
unixTime; // Artificial gregorian date (UNIX timestamp)
longitude; // Longitude (between -180¬∞ to +180¬∞)

year; // Current year (year 1: 2012/2013)
moon; // Current moon (between 1 and 14)

week; // Current week (between 1 and 53)
weekOfMoon; // Current week of the moon (between 1 and 4)

day; // Number of days passed since END_OF_ARTIFICIAL_TIME
dayOfYear; // Current day of the year (between 1 and 366)
dayOfMoon; // Current day of the moon (between 1 and 28)
dayOfWeek; // Current day of the week (between 1 and 7)

isRainbowDay; // True if current day is rainbow day

time; // Current time (between 0 and 359¬∞999999...)

yearStart; // Beginning of the year at the current longitude (UNIX timestamp)
yearDuration; // Numbers of days in the current year (between 365 and 366)
nadir; // Beginning of the day at the current longitude (UNIX timestamp)

static END_OF_ARTIFICIAL_TIME = 1356091200000; // 2012-12-22 00:00:00 at +180¬∞ East;
static MILLISECONDS_PER_DAY = 86400000; // 24*60*60*1000
```

**Utility functions**  

```javascript   
naturalDate.toString() // "004)04)01 113¬∞00 NT+5.2"
naturalDate.toDateString(separator = ')') // "004)04)01"
naturalDate.toTimeString(decimals = 2, rounding = 1) // "113¬∞00"
naturalDate.toLongitudeString(decimals = 1) // "NT+5.2"
naturalDate.toYearString() // "004"
naturalDate.toMoonString() // "04"
naturalDate.toDayOfMoonString() // "01"
```

More functions should be available later to make the NaturalDate class API mimic the native javascript Date class (ex: naturalDate.setYear(year)). Your help is welcome for this to happen ;-)

## `NaturalDateContext` functions

The NaturalDateContext.js file contains utility functions to bring some astronomical context to the natural date (ex: altitude of the sun, phase of the moon).

```javascript 
import { NaturalSunAltitude, NaturalSunEvents, NaturalMoonPosition, NaturalMoonEvents } from 'natural-time-js/context';

// Gizeh pyramide
let latitude: 29.9791; 
let longitude: 31.1341;

let naturalDate = new NaturalDate(new Date(), longitude);

NaturalSunAltitude(naturalDate, latitude);
// altitude: 31.779736404754367, 
// highestAltitude: 62.32114911751647

NaturalSunEvents(naturalDate, latitude);
// sunrise: 70.56708493448893,
// sunset: 287.9105974344889,
// nightStart: 306.43507660115563,
// nightEnd: 52.13781826782227,
// morningGoldenHour: 80.8551891011556,
// eveningGoldenHour: 277.58920993448896

NaturalMoonPosition(naturalDate, latitude);
// position: 526.0620760764069,
// phase: 74.86175469141531,
// altitude: 64.32391838504756,
// highestAltitude: 69.53997976716451

NaturalMoonEvents(naturalDate, latitude);
// moonrise: 139.14544743448894,
// moonset: 10.624722434488932
```

**Important !**  
Utility functions return time-distance from 0¬∞ or false if the event does not occur during this day (ex: no sunrise at the north pole during winter).

## Roadmap

1. Test in real life
2. Add typescript compatibility
3. Make NaturalDate feel like the Javascript native Date Class by adding features like
    - getTime()
    - setMoon()
    - ...
4. Make NaturalTime available for other programming languages

# Acknowledgments

Natural time has been baking for a long time in a goat's mind while traveling around the world. Infinite gratitude to my beloved friends Uncle Skywalker and Ik: your precious insights into the Mayan universe were so inspiring.

It was a real pleasure to give birth of natural time during the spring/summer of 2022 in the peaceful French alps.
